        I hope the Help Guide explained all of the things Kanjidex can do
        efficiently. If in any case you think there was something left out or if
        something's not clear, or worse yet, a bug, please, let me know at{" "}
        <strong>hello@kanjidex.com</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Likewise, feel free to give any sort of feedback or even just say hi. I
        will usually respond within two days unless I'm somewhere on the road
        (hopefully, somewhere in Japan) in which case it might be three or four
        days.
      </p>
